# Brainfuck Interpreter

This repository contains a simple implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter in Python, along with some sample programs. Brainfuck is a minimalistic programming language that only has eight commands and is Turing-complete. This implementation can read and execute Brainfuck code on any system with Python installed, making it a useful resource for experimenting with Brainfuck or writing your own programs.

## Usage

Example 1:
```bash
echo "ABC" | python brainfuckInterpreter.py Samples/HelloWorld.bf
```

Example 2: 
```bash
python brainfuckInterpreter.py Samples/HelloWorldBunny.bf
```

Example 3:
